### Task 1: Implement a Simple CLI Application
Description: Create a command-line interface (CLI) application in Rust that takes a file path
as input and counts the number of words, lines, and characters in the file. This task will help
the intern learn about Rust's file handling, string manipulation, and error handling.
Requirements:
- The application should accept a file path as an argument from the command line.
- It should read the contents of the file, and count the number of words, lines, and
characters.
- Display the results in the format:
```
Words: <number of words>
Lines: <number of lines>
Characters: <number of characters>
```
- Handle potential errors, such as a file not found or unable to read the file.
Learning Objectives:
- Understand Rust's syntax and basic data types.
- Learn about Rust's ownership model when handling file I/O.
- Implement error handling using `Result` and `Option` types.
